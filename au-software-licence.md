## License restrictions

Software licensing is generally done on either a "per user" or "per installation" basis. The way software is licenced depends on the kind of product getting sold.  For example, if software is installed on a server with multiple users - you probably want to sell it by user, since there's only a single installation.

### Licences sold per user

- Licences will be purchased by the Customer on a "per user" basis.
- The Service may be installed on multiple computers provided that only one individual is using the Service on those computers.

### Licences sold per installation

- Licences will be purchased by the Customer on a "per installation basis".
- Customer agrees to purchase one Licence for "each computer that the Service is installed on".
- Multiple individuals may use the Service provided it is "installed on one computer only".
