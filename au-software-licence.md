# au Simple EULA

`Purpose` This template is for the creation of simple EULAs for the licensing of software in the Australian market. This EULA is aimed towards software that is sold once: not a [subscription model](http://www.google.com).

`Jurisdiction` Australia


## Agreement

This agreement describes the license granted to the Customer for the Service. By installing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by this agreement.

## License

https://github.com/CodePact/au-components/blob/widgets/service_access.md

## License Restrictions

Software licensing is generally done on either a per user or per installation basis. The type of licenses that is appropriate depends on your business purpose. Consider what will be the typical usage of your customers.

### Licenses Per User

This license is valid for installation on multiple computers provided that there is only one primary individual using the Service on all of these computers.

### License Per Installation

The license is valid for installation and use on ONE computer at a time. Multiple individuals may use the Service provided it is only installed on one computer.

PAT: There is a need for language here that prevents the virtualisation dodge - You don't want the software being installed on one computer that then virtualises it to a bunch of different seats.
