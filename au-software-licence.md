# Software Licence

`Purpose` This template is for the creation of simple software licences (also known as "EULAs") in the Australian market. The document is aimed at software that is sold once: not software that's sold on a subscription model.

## Agreement creation

## License Restrictions

Software licensing is generally done on either a "per user" or "per installation" basis. The way software is licenced depends on the kind of product getting sold.  For example, if software is installed on a server with multiple users - you probably want to sell it by user, since there's only a single installation.

### Service licences sold per user

- Licences to use the Service under the Agreement will be purchased by the Customer on a "per user" basis.
- The Service may be installed on multiple computers provided that only one individual is using the Service on those computers.

### Service licences sold per installation

The license is valid for installation and use on ONE computer at a time. Multiple individuals may use the Service provided it is only installed on one computer.

PAT: There is a need for language here that prevents the virtualisation dodge - You don't want the software being installed on one computer that then virtualises it to a bunch of different seats.
